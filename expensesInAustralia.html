            your budget:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Accommodation:</b> The cost of housing can vary significantly
            depending on whether you choose to live on-campus, off-campus, or in

            $140 to $250 per week for shared accommodation and AUD $250 to $600

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Food:</b> Budget around AUD $80 to $140 per week for groceries if
            you cook your own meals. Eating out or ordering takeout can cost
            around AUD $10 to $20 for a basic meal.

            AUD $100 to $150. If you plan to use a car, consider expenses like
            fuel, insurance, and parking.
          </p>
          <p>

          <br />
          <p>
            It's important to research and plan your budget carefully to ensure
            you have enough funds to cover your living expenses throughout your
            stay. Keep in mind that cities like Sydney and Melbourne tend to
            have higher living costs compared to other cities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, check if your chosen institution provides any cost-of-living
            estimates or resources to help you plan your budget more accurately.
            Always have some extra funds for unexpected expenses and
            emergencies.
